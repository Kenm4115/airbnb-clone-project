2. Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
3. DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
4. QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

### Technology Stack

1. Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
2. Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
3. PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
4. GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
5. Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
6. Redis: Used for caching and session management.
7. Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
8. CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

2. Properties

    GET /properties/ - List all properties
    POST /properties/ - Create a new property
    GET /properties/{property_id}/ - Retrieve a specific property
    PUT /properties/{property_id}/ - Update a specific property
    DELETE /properties/{property_id}/ - Delete a specific property

3. Bookings

    GET /bookings/ - List all bookings
    POST /bookings/ - Create a new booking
    GET /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Retrieve a specific booking
    PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Update a specific booking
    DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Delete a specific booking

4. Payments

    POST /payments/ - Process a payment

5. Reviews

    GET /reviews/ - List all reviews
    POST /reviews/ - Create a new review
    GET /reviews/{review_id}/ - Retrieve a specific review
    PUT /reviews/{review_id}/ - Update a specific review
    DELETE /reviews/{review_id}/ - Delete a specific review

### Feature Breakdown

1. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

### API security

1. API Documentation
    1. OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
    2. Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
    3. GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
    1. Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
    2. Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage  user profiles.
3. Property Management
    1. Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
    2. Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
    1. Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
    2. Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
    1. Endpoints: /payments/
    2. Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
    1. Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
    2. Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
    1. Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
    2. Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

### CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CI/CD) are automated workflows that help streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying software. They ensure that code changes are integrated, tested, and released efficiently and reliably.

1. Why CI/CD is Important for a Project:
    1. Faster development: Automates repetitive tasks like building and testing, speeding up delivery.
    2. Improved code quality: Automatically runs tests on new code, catching bugs early.
    3. Consistent deployments: Reduces human error by automating the deployment process.
    4. Continuous feedback: Provides immediate alerts when something breaks, allowing faster fixes.

2. Tools for CI/CD:
    1. GitHub Actions – Automates workflows directly from your GitHub repository.
    2. Docker – Packages applications and their dependencies into containers for consistent environments.
    3. Jenkins – A customizable open-source automation server for building pipelines.
    4. GitLab CI/CD – Integrated CI/CD with GitLab repositories.
    5. CircleCI / Travis CI – Popular CI tools for automating tests and deployments.
